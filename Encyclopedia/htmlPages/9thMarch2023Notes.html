    <h1>Nuclear Reactions</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Nucleus Stability</h2>
        <p>Stable nuclei have...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                83 or fewer protons.
            </li>
            <li>
                Large unstable nuclei with more than 83 
                protons are radioactive. 
            </li>
            <li>
                As unstable nuclei decay (fission), they give 
                off energy.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Coal burning generating plant</h2>
        <p>
            The heat from burning coal turns water into steam. 
            Steam pressure turns the turbine.
        </p>
        <h2>Nuclear generating plant</h2>
        <p>
            The heat from fissioning uranium turns water into
            steam. Steam pressure turns the turbine.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Fission reactions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Uranium-235 nuclei can fission (split)
            </li>
            <li>
                The reaction products are smaller fission fragments, 
                fast moving neutrons and energy.
            </li>
            <li>
                A chain reaction occurs when other U-235 nuclei absorb 
                the neutrons. These U-235 nuclei fission and emit more 
                neutrons.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Energy from fission</h2>
        <p>Energy is released due to the difference in 
            binding energy between uranium nuclei and the 
            smaller nuclei of fission fragments.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Moderator and control rods</h2>
        <p>
            When U-235 nuclei fission, they emit fast moving 
            neutrons. Other U-235 nuclei absorb these neutrons 
            more easily when the neutrons move slowly.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A <b>moderator</b> (usually water of graphite) slows 
                the velocity of the fast-moving neutrons. Fuel rods 
                are placed in the moderator.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Control rods</b> control the rate of the reaction 
                by absorbing neutrons. Control rods (usually cadmium 
                or boron) can slow down or stop the reaction.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Fuel rods, coolant, containment systems</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Fuel rods or ceramic fuel pellets</b> are filled 
                with a mixture of two isotopes of uranium: U-235 and 
                U-238.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Coolant</b> (usually water or helium gas) transfers 
                heat from the reactor core to the vessel that produces 
                steam to turn the turbins.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Containment systems</b> prevent radiation from 
                escaping into the environment. Double containment 
                systems are safer.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>heat exchanger</b> heats water into steam. 
                Steam pressure turns the turbins that spin magnets 
                near coils of wire to generate electricity.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Fuel for conventional nuclear reactors</h2>
        <p>
            Naturally-occuring uranium ore consists of uranium-238 
            and uranium-235
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Ore is about 99.3% uranium-238 and only 0.7% 
                uranium-235.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fission reactors use U-235.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ore must be <b>enriched</b> to decrease the 
                percentage of U-238 and increase the percentage of 
                U-235.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Chernobyl reactor accident</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A power surge caused an uncontrolled fission chain 
                reaction.
            </li>
            <li>
                The water coolant molecules split into hydrogen and 
                oxygen gas. The gas exploded.
            </li>
            <li>
                Radioactive material was blown into the environment. 
                The graphite moderator caught on fire. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Initially, it was feared another uncontrolled chain 
                reaction could occur. It did not. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The reactor has been sealed by a massive arch. 
                The debris inside will remain radioactive for 
                thousands of years.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Fukushima nuclear accident</h2>
        <p>
            <b>What happened?</b> An earthquake triggered a tsunami 
            wave that flooded the Fukushima nuclear power plant.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Result: </b> A series of explosions and a meltdown 
            of three reactor cores released radition into the air and 
            the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Why did this happen?</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The backup generators and cooling system controls in the 
                basement of the building flooded.
            </li>
            <li>
                The reactor cores overheated.
            </li>
            <li>
                The intense heat split water into hydrogen and oxygen 
                gas. The hydrogen gas exploded.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>A safer reactor: </b>Reactor cores are placed at the 
            lowest level of the building. In an accident, water drains by 
            gravity to cool the reactor and prevent a meltdown.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Three Mile Island incident</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A loss of coolant allowed the fuel rods to overheat. 
                This caused a partial meltdown of the reactor core. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In an <b>uncontrolled chain reaction</b> (Chernobyl), 
                the rate of fission increaes out of control. An explosion 
                may result.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In a <b>meltdown</b> (Three Mile Island), the reactor may 
            be damaged by high heat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both accidents can release radiation into the environment. 
            An uncontrolled chain reaction is more dangerous.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Even in the coolant is lost, this reactor does not 
                overheat because the fuel is in small pebbles.
            </li>
            <li>
                The pebbles are spread out to dissipate heat.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Types of nuclear reactors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Reactors with fuel rods, graphite moderator, and water 
                coolant. (Chernobyl type) most dangerous type.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reactors with fuel rods, water moderator and water 
                coolant. (type used in U.S.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Reactors with small fuel pellets, water or graphite 
                moderator, and water or gas cooled. Safest type.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>
            Benefit of using water as both the moderator and coolant.
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If coolant is lost, then the moderator is also lost.
            </li>
            <li>
                Without the moderator to slow down the neutrons, the 
                chain reaction stops.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the coolant is lost, an uncontrolled chain reaction 
                will not happen. However, a melt down is possible.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Breeder reactors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Breeder reactor is plutonium-239
            </li>
            <li>
                Breeder reactors use fast neutrons. No moderator is 
                needed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Advantage: </b>As breeder reactors operate, they create 
            additional plutonium-239. Breeder reactors produce more 
            plutonium than they use.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Disadvantage: </b>Plutonium can be more easily converted 
            into nuclear weapons than can the byproducts of converntional 
            reactors.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Radioactive waste</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Used fuel rods from reactors are very radioactive. 
                Fuel rods are stored at each rector site in concrete 
                containers above ground or in pools of water.
            </li>
            <li>
                The fuel rods remain radioactive for thousands of 
                years.
            </li>
            <li>
                A plan to store radioactive fuel rods inside tunnels in 
                Yucca Mountain, Nevada, has been underway for several 
                decades. This plan has been suspended.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Health risks from nuclear vs coal plants</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Nuclear power plants produce no air pollution or 
                carbon dioxide.
            </li>
            <li>
                The health risk from nuclear power plans is low when 
                rectors are operating properly.
            </li>
            <li>
                However, the risk is unpredictable because a single 
                nuclear accident can cause much damage.
            </li>
            <li>
                The risk from coal-burning plants is high in terms of 
                air pollution and climate changes greenhouse gases.
            </li>
            <li>
                However, these three risks are predictable.
            </li>
        </ul>
