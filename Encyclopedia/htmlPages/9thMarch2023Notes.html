    <h1>Nuclear Reactions</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Nucleus Stability</h2>
        <p>Stable nuclei have...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                83 or fewer protons.
            </li>
            <li>
                Large unstable nuclei with more than 83 
                protons are radioactive. 
            </li>
            <li>
                As unstable nuclei decay (fission), they give 
                off energy.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Coal burning generating plant</h2>
        <p>The heat from burning coal turns water into steam. 
            Steam pressure turns the turbine.
        </p>
        <h2>Nuclear generating plant</h2>
        <p>The heat from fissioning uranium turns water into
            steam. Steam pressure turns the turbine.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Fission reactions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Uranium-235 nuclei can fission (split)
            </li>
            <li>
                The reaction products are smaller fission fragments, 
                fast moving neutrons and energy.
            </li>
            <li>
                A chain reaction occurs when other U-235 nuclei absorb 
                the neutrons. These U-235 nuclei fission and emit more 
                neutrons.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Energy from fission</h2>
        <p>Energy is released due to the difference in 
            binding energy between uranium nuclei and the 
            smaller nuclei of fission fragments.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Moderator and control rods</h2>
        <p>When U-235 nuclei fission, they emit fast moving 
            neutrons. Other U-235 nuclei absorb these neutrons 
            more easily when the neutrons move slowly.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A <b>moderator</b> (usually water of graphite) slows 
                the velocity of the fast-moving neutrons. Fuel rods 
                are placed in the moderator.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Control rods</b> control the rate of the reaction 
                by absorbing neutrons. Control rods (usually cadmium 
                or boron) can slow down or stop the reaction.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Fuel rods, coolant, containment systems</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Fuel rods or ceramic fuel pellets</b> are filled 
                with a mixture of two isotopes of uranium: U-235 and 
                U-238.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Coolant</b> (usually water or helium gas) transfers 
                heat from the reactor core to the vessel that produces 
                steam to turn the turbins.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Containment systems</b> prevent radiation from 
                escaping into the environment. Double containment 
                systems are safer.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>heat exchanger</b> heats water into steam. 
                Steam pressure turns the turbins that spin magnets 
                near coils of wire to generate electricity.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Fuel for conventional nuclear reactors</h2>
        <p>
            Naturally-occuring uranium ore consists of uranium-238 
            and uranium-235
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Ore is about 99.3% uranium-238 and only 0.7% 
                uranium-235.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fission reactors use U-235.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ore must be <b>enriched</b> to decrease the 
                percentage of U-238 and increase the percentage of 
                U-235.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Chernobyl reactor accident</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A power surge caused an uncontrolled fission chain 
                reaction.
            </li>
            <li>
                The water coolant molecules split into hydrogen and 
                oxygen gas. The gas exploded.
            </li>
            <li>
                Radioactive material was blown into the environment. 
                The graphite moderator caught on fire. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Initially, it was feared another uncontrolled chain 
                reaction could occur. It did not. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The reactor has been sealed by a massive arch. 
                The debris inside will remain radioactive for 
                thousands of years.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Fukushima nuclear accident</h2>
        <p><b>What happened?</b> An earthquake triggered a tsunami 
        wave that flooded the Fukushima nuclear power plant.</p>
        <p><b>Result: </b> A series of explosions and a meltdown 
        of three reactor cores released radition into the air and 
        the ocean.</p>
        <p><b>Why did this happen?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The backup generators and cooling system controls in the 
                basement of the building flooded.
            </li>
            <li>
                The reactor cores overheated.
            </li>
            <li>
                The intense heat split water into hydrogen and oxygen 
                gas. The hydrogen gas exploded.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>A safer reactor: </b>Reactor cores are placed at the 
        lowest level of the building. In an accident, water drains by 
        gravity to cool the reactor and prevent a meltdown.</p>
