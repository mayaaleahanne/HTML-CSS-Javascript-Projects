    <h1>Nuclear Reactions</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Nucleus Stability</h2>
        <p>Stable nuclei have...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                83 or fewer protons.
            </li>
            <li>
                Large unstable nuclei with more than 83 
                protons are radioactive. 
            </li>
            <li>
                As unstable nuclei decay (fission), they give 
                off energy.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Coal burning generating plant</h2>
        <p>The heat from burning coal turns water into steam. 
            Steam pressure turns the turbine.
        </p>
        <h2>Nuclear generating plant</h2>
        <p>The heat from fissioning uranium turns water into
            steam. Steam pressure turns the turbine.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Fission reactions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Uranium-235 nuclei can fission (split)
            </li>
            <li>
                The reaction products are smaller fission fragments, 
                fast moving neutrons and energy.
            </li>
            <li>
                A chain reaction occurs when other U-235 nuclei absorb 
                the neutrons. These U-235 nuclei fission and emit more 
                neutrons.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Energy from fission</h2>
        <p>Energy is released due to the difference in 
            binding energy between uranium nuclei and the 
            smaller nuclei of fission fragments.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Moderator and control rods</h2>
        <p>When U-235 nuclei fission, they emit fast moving 
            neutrons. Other U-235 nuclei absorb these neutrons 
            more easily when the neutrons move slowly.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A <b>moderator</b> (usually water of graphite) slows 
                the velocity of the fast-moving neutrons. Fuel rods 
                are placed in the moderator.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Control rods</b> control the rate of the reaction 
                by absorbing neutrons. Control rods (usually cadmium 
                or boron) can slow down or stop the reaction.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Fuel rods, coolant, containment systems</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Fuel rods or ceramic fuel pellets</b> are filled 
                with a mixture of two isotopes of uranium: U-235 and 
                U-238.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Coolant</b> (usually water or helium gas) transfers 
                heat from the reactor core to the vessel that produces 
                steam to turn the turbins.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Containment systems</b> prevent radiation from 
                escaping into the environment. Double containment 
                systems are safer.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>heat exchanger</b> heats water into steam. 
                Steam pressure turns the turbins that spin magnets 
                near coils of wire to generate electricity.
            </li>
        </ol>
