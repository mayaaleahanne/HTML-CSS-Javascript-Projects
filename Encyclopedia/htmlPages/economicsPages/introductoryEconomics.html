    <h1>Introductory Economics</h1>
    <h2>What is microeconomics?</h2>
    <p>
        Microeconomics is the study of how individuals and firms make 
        decisions in a world of scarcity (what drives microeconmics). 
        Microeconomics is a series of constrained optimization exercises, 
        where economics agents (firms of indivduals) try to make themselves 
        as well of as possible given their constraints.
    </p>
    <h2>Tradeoffs</h2>
    <p>
        Opportunity cost: Every action (or inaction) has a cost. Everything
         done has a next best alternative of what could've been done instead. 
         This is why economics is called the "dismal science". Nothing is 
         free.
