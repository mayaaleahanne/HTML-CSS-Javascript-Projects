        <h2>What is microeconomics?</h2>
        <p>
            Microeconomics is the study of how individuals and firms make 
            decisions in a world of scarcity (what drives microeconmics). 
            Microeconomics is a series of constrained optimization exercises, 
            where economics agents (firms of indivduals) try to make themselves 
            as well of as possible given their constraints.

        <h2>Tradeoffs</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Opportunity cost:</b> Every action (or inaction) has a cost. Everything
            done has a next best alternative of what could've been done instead. 
            This is why economics is called the "dismal science". Nothing is 
            free.

        <h2>Supply and Demand</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Water diamond paradox:</b> the supply of water is almost infinite 
            although water is valuable. Meanwhile diamonds aren't as necessary, 
            but they're rarer. Introduces the notion that supply and demand 
            cannot be considered in isolation (supply and demand scissors). 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Market equilibrium:</b> where consumers and producers are ready to 
            make a transaction.
        </p>

        <h2>Positive vs normative analysis</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Positive analysis:</b> the way things are.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Normative analysis:</b> the way things should be.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Market failures:</b> the reasons why the market doesn't work 
                how economists said it would. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Equity:</b> 
            </li>
